# AIM Consulting Data Engineering Software Challenge

## About
Script will utilize the Python 'requests' libary. The script fetches and consumes data from API that tracks the maintenance of Stock Keeping Unit Idenfitifiers (SKUs) by filtering records to only include those which were created on or after January 1, 2022. Afterwards, it then gives a count of the number of filtered records and prints the count value to the console.

## Usage
1. Clone repository and identify location of the script file (_aimconsulting.py_).
2. Assure that Python and the latest version of the  Python 'requests' library is installed on the machine. (Note: 'requests' python library can be installed by running the command: _'pip install requests'_)
4. Open command prompt and change directories to the directory in which the script is located.
5. Run the following command to execute the script: "_python aimconsulting.py_"
6. Script will execute and fetch the data from the API, filter the records to only show values after January 1,2022 and finally print the count to the console.
